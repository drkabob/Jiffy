# Jiffy: The GIF Creating Plugin

## What is the Jiffy plugin?
This is the source code for the Chrome extension [Jiffy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jiffy-the-gif-creating-pl/nlcjegmhpnnlbkpcfbechbjicnakhben)

Jiffy is an extension that turns parts of YouTube videos into GIF images that you can then share with your friends, post on social media, whatever you want. No longer do you need to go to separate sites or download complicated tools onto your computer. With Jiffy, all you need to do is navigate to the YouTube video that you want to make a GIF out of and Jiffy will be right below the video player.

### Help! The plugin isn't working or I can't set it up or I'm getting weird errors or I've grown a third arm!
You can find help by posting something on JiffyBot's [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/JiffyBot).
If nobody gets to it you might want to [contact the bot's developer on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=drkabob).

## How can I help?
We're actively looking for new features, bug fixes, etc. for Jiffy. If you want to help you can fork the repo on GitHub and submit a pull request when you're done.

As far as guidelines go we aren't too picky, just try to follow PEP8 for antying in Python, comment your code so everyone knows what it does. (I'll be sure to do the same in the future.)
Also, try to stick with the standard library.

## License
The bot is licensed under GPL v3. Please view the license file in [docs/LICENSE](https://github.com/drkabob/Jiffy/blob/master/JiffyPlugin/docs/LICENSE).


## Who are the people behind Jiffy?
Jiffy (the plugin) is based on JiffyBot which was originally conceived by John O'Reilly. He manages the [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/JiffyBot), bug tests, requests features, and pretty much everything that isn't writing code.
You can find him on [twitter](http://twitter.com/John_O_Really), [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/u/GoogaNautGod), and you can check out [his webcomic](http://purplejottedtittles.com/).

Jiffy was created by Nathan Hakkakzadeh. He writes code and makes sure the bot doesn't crash. If you have any technical questions or advice, he's the one who takes them.
You can find him on [twitter](http://twitter.com/drkabob), [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/u/drkabob), and [his website](http://www.welcometonathan.com/) (try to find all the secrets!).
